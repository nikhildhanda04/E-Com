eCommerce Project (Skill Enhancement)
This project is a simple eCommerce website built using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It is designed to showcase my skills in front-end development, state management, and responsive design. The project contains key eCommerce components like a navbar, carousel, and responsive design features.
In the future, I will also be adding a backend to it.
